Not one bit of resistance from my body as I pulled my legs up from the ground; it was finally ready and able to support me and the strength I found in that moment has just sent immense shock-waves of positive energy through every fibre of my being.

I have no idea what a hip point is. I keep nearly falling over during the warrior pose bit, and there's no mention of balance so I must be doing something wrong but there's no explanation as to what that could be it's just assumed that I will somehow know. The instructions for the downward dog bit are super unclear, \"listen to your body\" well my legs are far to tight to do this and my arms are telling me they are going to drop me on my face so either I'm doing it wrong or it's a much more advanced pose than is being let on. If I can't walk my hands up on to my thighs during the kneeling bit how am I supposed to move my arms around without falling on my face. At one point she says knit your lower ribcage together, what the actual hell does that mean?

Thirty days ago, I was nursing a chronic back injury and experiencing a lot of pain from what appeared to be a pinched nerve.

(never even been held by her grandparents as she was born the day of the lock down)\nI wanted to do something for me during the day and this seemed like the perfect thing, I've never really believed in the whole yoga thing but after doing the even the first session I feel so much better I have more energy already.

I didn\u2019t know what to do. I spent two days sleeping, crying out loud. And then it hit me. Let\u2019s do day 1 with Adrien again. It\u2019s easy, I don\u2019t have to go out, I don\u2019t have to change my outfit, I can I do it right here, right now. And I did it. I feel a bit better now. I feel like I have to do your workouts more often. Your calming voice, but yet alive and funny really are medicine to me. Thank you Adrien from the bottom of my heart.",

It has massively changed and helped my flexibility, my back and my breathing.  It was worth every single day to get onto the mat and start the video.  The journey coming to an end for me was quite sad cos I get attached to routines very quickly, but if you're thinking of doing this then I highly recommend it!  Thank you Adriene for helping me find a love for Yoga.  And for any newcomers still reading this, don't give up!  You'll get to the final day and thank yourself whilst beaming with pride and maybe feeling a little sad that it's all over.",

We have done it twice in a row now. My mom has been the most flexible in years and I am handling my anxiety so much better now along with losing some weight. Today was suppose to be our break before trying the new shift program. However, after a bad day at work I knew I needed some yoga. My mom and I are addicted now, can\u2019t go a day without getting on the mat. Thank you Adriene. With your encouragement and welcoming nature two new yogi start their journey.

            "Last year I moved out of state to live with my grandma, after a series of unfortunate events which led me to be homeless(caused by me, no excuses) and for awhile I was doing nothing but moping and drinking and laying in bed on my laptop in the basement... my knees were literally crackling and popping every time I would stand up or bend down.  Sometimes there would even be an excruciating pain that would shoot into my left knee when I would just be standing still.  A few times in the middle of the night I would wake up with a sharp pain in my back from my bad posture. I wasn't overweight or anything, but being depressed and sitting around all day was literally destroying my body.  For the first time In my life I was starting to suffer from panic attacks from all the alcohol and stress and the occasional drug use.  The girl I was seeing at the time who I was in a long distant relationship from the state I moved from broke up with me one night...she was the love of my life and my only friend I had left in the world... I literally lost all hope.  That very same night after coming home from the bar drunk and seeing the breakup message, I just typed in \"yoga\" on youtube, in a last ditch effort to basically save my life.  Up popped this video... 30 day yoga challenge.    I remember Doing \"day 1\" while still drunk and tears still running down my face.  To be honest it sucked, my feet, wrists, knees, neck, back, shoulders, all hurt while following along.. But I did it.  I stuck with it.  I have done the challenge twice, and now I'm doing it a third time.  I feel so amazing.  So amazing that I felt the need to leave this comment.  As corny as it sounds.. I strongly believe your videos saved me from a pit of despair that I probably would have never gotten out of if I didn't change.  Anyways.. Namaste :)",

I am healthier and stronger than I have ever been at 33 years old. I have friends coming over to share the video and start their journey too.

I'm certified as a yoga instructor myself, and I'm a bigger woman--not huge; I'm just shy of 5'10\", and I wear a size 16 in most clothing, but I definitely don't look like Francesca or Caroline, or any of the (very talented) women you usually get to demonstrate poses.

            "I enjoyed this very much. Loved the guidance so I didn't have to look up at the screen too much. I'm a beginner, so it was nice to see the poses I can work towards in my practice. Thank you.",
            "i practiced this just today and i think i need more training in this video to achieve the right poses. Thankyou! This really helps.",
            "Wow the sweat is real \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Great production quality and sequence was nice! Unfortunately, the over-cuing was distracting and it was difficult to sync breathing with the poses.",
            "I use this every time during my yoga practice! Thank you!!!",
            "Fantastic instruction from Briohny very clear and with just enough emphasis on alignment and holding the poses as well as understanding how poses affect your body. Strong basis For those who think she talks too much should try to do this sequence by listening to the instructions without looking at the video.",
            "Thank you Briohny - great class!!",
            "The best, calming, feel-good flow. Thank you!",

            "Thank you \u2764 I'm getting back into yoga after 15 years away from doing it. You're a great teacher! My teachers at the studio talk us through it as you do. I appreciate that so much as I'm so conscientious about my poses that I can't always see what's going on around me w/o quick peeks. Your gentle guidance is much appreciated by me. I saved this video to my library for those days I don't make it to class. I try to go every 2 days, so this will be perfect for me on those inbetween days. Namaste \ud83d\udc9b",
            "Thank you, Briohny!  I loved the flow, all the variations you offer and your instruction!  Looking forward to doing this video again soon. Namaste!",

            "I appreciate you, thank you very much \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",
            "I loved this flow. I had a yoga class last year for my fall semester and I absolutely loved my instructor. We mostly focused on this kind of yoga; vinyasa flow and I find that this is the only yoga that really helps out my anxiety lol Sometimes, she would do a bit more of a meditative practice where we focus on what our body emotionally needed. She challenged us and at times It was hard and i wanted to give up, but she was encouraging but tough at the same time. I was just starting college and, I wasn\u2019t ready to accept the change that comes with graduating. College felt very hard for me; heavy and the practice every time I had class with it\u2019s challenges and the way my body would respond helped me so much. It was like my therapy. I almost wanted to cry sometimes lol and this video is the closest that I\u2019ve found. I love the pace and the practice",
            "Great Practice! Kept me focused and mindful. Felt very relaxed after! Thanks Briohny :)",
            "Thank you for this video. I was feeling really anxious today and unable to stick to my practice. I followed this video, so my mind can just surrender and listen to the instructions without thinking or obsessing. I feel great, I love the hip openers and I did feel an emotional release too. Thank you for the detailed instructions. Lots of love and happiness to you. Namaste \u2764\ufe0f",

            "my gosh she is so good- love, love, love",
            "I really enjoyed this practice, thank you, Briohny!",
            "She was amazing. She gave perfect instructions and made me feel like it was okay to feel tired through out it. A lot of other instructors dont give you that reassurance that everything doesnt have to look perfect",
            "amazing session! the instructions were in perfect balance with the flow!! thank you!",
            "This was great for my unused body or so it felt haha. This was the first I\u2019ve practiced in almost a year, personal decision. I\u2019m happy to have  practice with a great guide!!!\nThank you...",
            "THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! I got my first ever successful crow pose today because of you! The note about rounding out my shoulder blades was all I needed for the strength in my core to balance and hold. I cried with such happiness. There were several other pose holds that were very helpful, but you have no idea how much joy that one brought to my practice! <3 Thank you",

            "Super random feedback that I'm sure I'm alone in feeling - I found it hard to relax because your voice is very strong. I find my practice is more peaceful and effective when the teacher speaks in really soft, relaxing tones. Anyway - thank you very much. All the best.",

            "I would just like to say thank you for sharing this practice and it makes me sad to see negative criticism being delivered in such harsh and unkind ways. I'm a teacher, and there is always a way to offer constructive criticism without being demeaning.  ~Namaste",

            "I love how you actually tell viewers how to do the poses, even those as 'basic' as small cobra, as you go, and transition slowly into each pose so people can actually see how you got there. I usually find on yoga videos the instructors fly from one pose to the next and sometimes hold them for hardly any time so I don't even know if I'm doing them properly. So thanks!",

If you don\u2019t like it move on \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f no need to leave you\u2019re unkind opinionated feedback.\nSo many students look around for directions and the best most successful instructors I\u2019ve known speak as they flow because it helps your alignment and keeps the class rolling vs boring",

            "hello briohny! Thank you for this video, it was super fucking awesome! It made me feel amazing!\nThe only one little thing that I think your routine is missing, is a stretch for the quads at the very end. Since the chair pose is recruiting all the muscles at the hip, it would be important that quads and rec fems get lengthen afterwards!",

            "Thank you! I really enjoyed it! I really liked that you do balanced poses in an advanced way, really inspirering to me :) You are so strong!",

            "I am not usually a fan of yoga. It tends to make me very anxious and tense, so for years I avoided it. But today I decided to give it another shot and I'm very glad I did! This video was so calming that I paused it at the end and just lay on my mat for a few minutes, more relaxed than I've been in a long time. Thank you! I'm ready to take on the day now!",
            "Yo what the heck my leg was having a seizure at 18:14 that was hard :(",
            "It has been a long time since I have done yoga and I am glad I found this video. It is just what I needed and I was able to appreciate what my body can do. I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and gratitude. :)",
            "Thank you for this great video. The best one I came across so far. Is there anyway I can train to have my leg higher when I'm in 3 legs dog or split?",
            "Another lovely flow. Really enjoyed my practice today. Thank you",
            "Really enjoy these vinyasa flows. Keep it up!",
            "Each yoga pose has 5 deep breaths to go with to continue the flow but because she talks to much she stays too long in each pose, that is why some people find it irritating that you have to stay in one pose until she is done talking.",
            "Beautiful practice. Lovely flow for first thing in the morning. Built just the right amout of heat. Thank you, Briohny, for your soothing and approachable instruction, and for sharing this routine. (Love the warrior reference and imagery) Namaste.",
            "Can anyone recommend a good yoga video without any downward dog poses?",
            "She is nice but too many explanations and talking in general",
            "so informative! felt great and challenged! keep them coming!",
            "Great video, instruction is awsome,  she really doesnt give you a free ride on any of the poses like in many youtube yoga vids forces you to do the pose properly. Maybe that why some commenters think she talks to much?",
            "I personally feel that too much talking or the instructions keeps the mind and body engaged. Briohny\u2019s Yoga session is quiet challenging and helps build that core.",
            "Goals!!!!",
            "Fabulous darling!",
            "I want to try Yoga but it makes me nervous.",
            "She talks way to much. I had to quit 10 minutes in",
            "When I consider all the tutorials I follow to learn poses such as Bakasana, and all the scaffolding necessary, I am amazed at the assumptions reflected in this video about what people can do as beginners of the practice with a few instructions that actually rely on months and months of strength/flexibility  building, proprioception and general body awareness. Like teaching algebra to people still learning basic calculations. She should just start by saying this is a level 2 and higher session. It can take years to develop the kind of core it takes to hop up as she does, being sure to focus on knees to chest as opposed to flipping up feet, which many newbies will do. Just offer some level 1 videos as well as these advanced ones so people don't hurt themselves.",
            "She's so graceful!!!!!",
            "Love this flow too! I try to do it every morning after my first cup of green tea :) Thank you again Bri!!!",

Although I am still beginner, I want to be as good as Bri, able to do the hopping and strengthen my arms (I can't do chatauranga properly \ud83d\ude02) one day perhaps...one day.\nP/S: Bri, were you a singer about 14 years ago? I think I have bought some of your CDs back then.",

            "Maybe great for yoga newbies. If you already practice yoga, save yourself the time and unfulfilling practice and check out another (this never built heat or a constant flow) - one of my faves is my local Austin studio Black Swan Yoga. Thanks for posting free videos, though, Alo Yoga!",

            "Amazing video",
            "Or a great yoga teacher",
            "I have all her stuff on Cody.. I personally think she speaks too much about the postures. This is just me. Also there were postures in there that you should be warmed up for more... Like standing splits this is why I'm a fan of @jessicaolie a on alo she is slowly speaking but you get the flexibility and breathwork. I think there are teachers for everyone. She's just not for me and that's OK. I think she is beautiful and strong and life changing. I do take a class once in a while. It's powerful. Just not something that's for me. Be we are all different and that's the beautiful thing about life",
            "I personally have my preferred instructors, but trying new flows (even those with familiar poses) can reward in many more ways. Loved the little pointing-hands opposite leg core element. Gonna add it to my own practice.",

            "Very peaceful thank you",
            "Perfect!   Loved the practice; loved the instructor.  I would call this practice a little more intermediate.  It's not too hard, but the beginners with me found it difficult.",
            "very slow paced with too many explanations and not enough focus on the practice itself",
            "Though I liked this sequence, and I agree with other commenters that the balance between upper and lower body strengthening was good, I don't think that instructor comments about \"burning calories\" or \"feeling thin\" have any place in a yoga practice. Not everyone wants to burn extra calories or be thin, and these should hardly be the focuses of a practice that is meant to nourish the soul and body",
            "i agree with other, she talks WAAAAAAY too much......couldnt concentrate on the practice.....",
            "Over explains everything.",

During power flows Im usually listening for cues or instructions to move into the next pose because the flows are usually at an accelerated speed.

People like Kassandra and Adrienne have helped me with fighting; having open hips helps with punch and kicking power, as anyone who enjoys fighting knows. My kicks started improving after I realized how tight my helps were, so I started looking up yoga on the internet to help my hips become more loose and smoove. Now my body feels so much better its crazy. My friend got me on the pidgeon pose and that's some shit I never would do a year ago. Quarantine is kinda weird and shit's crazy right now, but at the very least I'm happy I had the privilege to find a new passion of mine. Namaste.",

I need to stretch a lot and build stability. I'm Christian and I'm concerned if I won't do something wrong. I believe only on our Father and the Holy Spirit and and I'm afraid of yoga background like energy, chakras, workship for hindu goddes and etc. I don't believe in that stuff. But is that enough? I see part of yoga - its positions as isometric exercises and I do my workout at home. I would never go to a yoga class. I don't meditate, I don't listen to the hindu music and etc. Is it ok? Am I opening energy levels and adore fake idols while I'm not intended and just doing asanas as an exercise? I pray to God for protection from evil and guidance. I'm very afraid of possessions and such things! I'm very stressed and thinking a lot about all this stuff nowadays. Please, I need your answer. Thank you!",

            "Have to say I really love this I have a health condition that means I can't always go hard, but this is gentle but helps get the kinks out. Thank you very much",
            "This was great. It really did help me start my morning and relieve all of the tensi\u00f3n my body had.",
            "I've done yoga on and off for years and that was a whole lot of new stuff for me. Thanks for the refreshing set. The only thing I would ask is to give a bit more time to each posture because just as I would get adjusted and settled  into a new one it would be time transition. But as always, I'm a fan!",
            "I love this slow yoga on your channel Sarah Beth! I always expect it to seem long but it actually goes quicker than normal paced yoga. Feels so good!",
            "I love your stretches, I have been disabled for such a long time with an auto immune disorder, but am I finally beginning to start doing yoga and your stretches have help strengthen my core . So Many many Namaste to you.",
            "Every time I saw a 20mins stretching video, I always assume \u2018yeah, a breeze\u2019 but WRONG again! This was the toughest yet but amazing video nonetheless! Love all the poses which I have not done for a while: the cow legs and shifting back and sit on our heels (as I have pain in one knee, It was really difficult on one side but on the other side, it was perfect.) And it\u2019s great to try some of those poses I have never come across: toes hug and the other one, whilst in low lunge, we have our hands inside one of the knee/leg which was at the edge of the mat while trying to sit the opposite hip on the mat (this I found quite strong, I don\u2019t seem to be able to straighten my arms while keeping my the opposite knee/leg in its original place on the mat ). I will definitely have to add this to my regular practice as after the practice, it has lessened the knee pain, I expect this was as a result that all the associated muscle to the knee have been stretched. Thanks!",
            "Does anyone know where I can find the background music? It's so calming \ud83d\ude2d",
            "New Yoga person here! Wfh in my chair compared to the ergo set up I had in the office has taken a toll on my posture. This video was really great at getting those pain points to stretch out!",
            "This channel is the only one I have been able to find that gives me the same exact feeling as when I'm in the studio. Subscribed and hit notifications. I have already created a summer schedule for when I will do each of your videos!! Thank you!",

            "Ohhh wow! I enjoyed it soo much that 20 mins seem too short \ud83d\ude02. Thank you for this. Love it.",
            "Wow, I really needed this! After having run and walked a lot this weekend, my joints and muscles were in major pain.  This calming stretching routine reminded me I must do this more regularly.  Love your style of teaching as well!",
            "That was also a wonderful way to stretch out a very tight back situation! Thank you!",
            "Hi, thanks for the class.\nI need some advice please!\nI can't cross my leg over the other for the cow legs at the end? Not flat anyway. Hips are like stone. Any ideas? Cheers, Adam",
            "I have to say, for my second yoga session ever, this was really tough - felt a lot of pain in the hips and knees, pretty much the whole time, but damn did my body feel relaxed when it was over! I will definitely keep going, it will probably be pretty awesome to be able to hold these positions without so much effort and pain involved.",
            "THAT WAS SO GREAT! I love the stretches! just wish that their was more music...",
            "Being in quarantine and spending too much time on the sofa or in bed, this is definitely what I needed. I might have cried a little and asked God for help but it was worth it. You have just gained a new follower.",
            "Ahh love the toe hugs! It\u2019s crazy how more spaced out my toes have become over the years , we truly become more grounded! Question though ,  when going to sit back on ankle and do hamstring stretch are you suppose to be tightening your knee/ quad? This is a question that I ask myself a lot of the time but never know! Love your channel ! Thank you \ud83d\udc4f",
            "I really loved this class! But my absolute favorite was the second to last one",

            "these are some great stretches. my muscles feel a whole lot better especially my hamstrings and hip flexors!",
            "This was amazing. One of my favorite poses is cow facing legs. It's my most challenging area. I also, really liked the pose at 7:00 minutes in.",
            "The toe hug was the weirdest yet the best feeling of this routine! I\u2019ll definitely come back to this to improve my flexibility and decompress \ud83d\udc97",
            "I've missed a couple morning with you, and i feel it.  I loved the toe stretch with hands, more of that please!!! <3 happy weekend",
            "You're amazing. The minute you said \"Trust\", My eyes started watering. Thank you for this beautiful session.",
            "I'm trying to get into contortion training (or would like too) after doing yoga for almost 2 years now, but I have to build my flexibility to insane amounts first, so these are perfect for that. Thank you. I know I'm like a year and a half late on commenting though lol",
            "I love this yoga lesson, I've been doing it for the past 2 days now. But I was just wondering if it's ok for my back. Coz I suffer from back pain so I was just curious. I can't tell you if my back is better or worse coz it's only been 2 days and my back hurts all the time so I won't know the difference yet.\nI haven't been diagnosed with anything as of yet, but my back hurts from the outside of my spine and works it way down the whole of my back.",
            "Never dismiss a simple routine! I have been really sore from my Fibromyalgia and needed something gentle to stretch out my back, hips and shoulders. This was perfect!",

Ive been  using your videos on and off for a few years now and each time I come back I notice I have muscle memory and can take some of the stretches even further than the last time! Your videos are the best, I recommend them to anyone saying they don't have time or discipline. If I can, anyone can!",

I appreciate them so much. It is a space without judgement that I look forward to everyday! The calm deep breathing is my favorite part! So many yoga teachers seem to fly thru different poses.

            "I love your videos SaraBeth. I've been following for several years and now as an older yogi in lockdown grateful for yoga and the 3 decades of practice. I loved the cow legs but needed the modification which wasn't as clear as i would have liked, but I managed. Many thanks",

            "This was the perfect stretch after my strength training and running! I especially welcomed the move the lengthens the shins and front of the legs! After running so much my body really needed that lengthening and stretching. I will be doing this video a few times a week in between long runs.",

            "Just starting doing yoga and I feel amazing! The number one tip I would give someone starting out is not to tense just let the pose happen. Another thing is you might think your gonna pull a muscle or something if you go any farther but trust me that thought was keeping me from getting further into my yoga postures just let your body naturally stretch \ud83d\ude01",
            "I was in a very negative mood towards myself.Doing this really helped me shift into a more loving state of mind.I was surprised! Thank you Sarah \u263a",

            "I have to start doing this everyday",
            "The description of cow facing legs is way too fast and unclear. I\u2019ve watched it over and over. Between the black leggings and the jump cut, I have absolutely no clue how to get from a down dog to a position anything like the one you are in. And there\u2019s no explanation of how to get into the modification either. I really wish this were made clear. This was a huge disruption to the flow of the practice.",

            "Thanks for the 20min stretch video. I love the music and your voice. New subscriber here! I don\u2019t stretch as often as I should and only do it when my emotions go downhill- which is terrible because I know that yoga and stretching helps my mind find peace. Often when I feel emotional or stressed, stretching helps to release the tension not just in the muscles but more importantly my mind as well. I find myself crying on my mat. Is it just me or am I just abnormal?",
            "That was my favorite yoga video and I've done a million. Thank youuuuuu",

            "Good morning Sarah! Thank you so much for alllll your videos and the way you talk us through them movements and postures. First time leaving a comment. I am a runner and this video was great for me. I loved the cow legs. I had a hard time with the booty drops but I\u2019ll just have to try that again. Loved the toe hug. Loved the first hip opening exercise. I was surprised by the ending. I recommend your videos and app all the time to runners I coach and any people I know.",

I am almost ready to get back into the gym after more than 1 year pause due to a slipped disk. I subscribed and will keep doing your yoga stretches at home. THANK YOU!",

            "I'm an avid yogi of 8 years and I woke up feeling SO tight this morning, as if I'd never practiced yoga in my life!

            "Thank you so much for this! My husband and I both have very stressful work lives and thus realized it started affecting our home life, we have no only been doing these yoga vids every for about two weeks now but wow! It has changed our lives. Not only are we more calmer when it comes to work but our whole house always feels so calm and zen after every yoga session. With every yoga session we would release all the stress of the day and then have the rest of our night to just enjoy each other\u2019s company. Thank you for that.",

            "Such a clear step by step description...I could close my eyes and do the yoga so peacefully..thanks",
            "This class is very professionally done and I loved it. However as a longtime Yogi and personal trainer, I know that it is not a full body stretch. It is primarily a lower body stretch and a forward folding stretching class. There really isn\u2019t any spinal extension and barely any upper body stretching. Again I loved it and would recommend it but think you should rename it.",
            "Thank you ! I'm feeling better ! \ud83d\ude03\nPlease make a lower back stretch .",

            "Hi, it\u2019s the first time I tried it. It was really difficult, I couldn\u2019t fold or stretch the way you\u2019ve told us to do. Though I really enjoyed it.I\u2019m wondering if it would be better for me with more exercising. Thank you",
            "I like your yoga so much ! Thank you!",
            "Great video.  I liked the narration by someone other than the person doing the movements.  I also liked the toe/finger interweaving--I never ran across that before.  Only suggestion--the person demonstrating wore a dark sweater and dark pants--it was difficult to see some of the leg positions from a distance, so maybe try two distinct colors or even pants with long stripes.",

Today I felt one coming on, and I immediately grabbed my mat and went outside to do this practice. Words cannot express how much it helped.

It is a progress that I do stand up and leave, earlier in my lifetime I'd just shut down and probably have a huge panic attack with other people needing to get me help. ",

The more I focused on it , it got progressively worse. this helped me not only to deeply knead out the muscle tissue and relax it, but also to pivot my focus onto releasing  mentally which in turn also helps physically.  Any time I tried to deal with my predicament, it resulted in maybe a little relief sometimes, but usually just more tightening. It was a vicious cycle. By the time I found this I was at a point where I was lucky if I got a whole day without tightening and locking up. And, if I did get a day without it, i could still feel a little soreness from the last episode. Every time that soreness would eventually lead back into the cycle by night time.
